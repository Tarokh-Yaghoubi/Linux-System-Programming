0. Write configure.ac 
1. aclocal -> read configure.ac file and generate aclocal.m4 and sets the macros
2. autoconf -> generate the configure script
3. write Makefile.am
4. automake -> take "Makefile.am" and generate "Makefile.in"
5. ./configure -> take the "Makefile.in" and generate the final Makefile
